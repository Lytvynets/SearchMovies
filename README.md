# SearchMovies

You'll need [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) installed for of our dependencies.
    
    $ gem install cocoapods
    
Now you'll need to build the dependencies.
    
    $ pod install
 launch 
 
    SearchMovies.xcworkspace
    
 If there is an error during the build   
 Xcode version 14.3 may cause an error, so you need to install the minimum version of iOS 11 on all Pods
